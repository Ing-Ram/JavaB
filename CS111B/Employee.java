   /**
   1.	Define a class named Employee whose
    objects are records for employees. 
    Derive this class from the class Person 
    given in Lesson. An employee record 
    inherits an employeeâ€™s name from the 
    class Person. In addition, an employee 
    record contains an annual salary 
    represented as a single value of 
    type double, a hire date that gives the 
    year hired as a single value of 
    type int, and an identification number that
    is a value of type String. 
    Give your class a reasonable
    complement of constructors, 
    accessor methods, and mutator methods. 
    Write a program to fully test your class
    definition.
