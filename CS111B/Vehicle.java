3.	Create a base class called Vehicle that 
has the manufacturerâ€™s name (type String), number of 
cylinders in the engine (type int), and owner 
(type Person given in Lesson). Then create a class 
called Truck that is derived from Vehicle and has
additional properties: the load capacity in tons 
(type double, since it may contain a fractional part) 
and towing capacity in tons (type double). Give your 
classes a reasonable complement of constructors and 
accessor methods. Write a driver program that tests 
all your methods.
